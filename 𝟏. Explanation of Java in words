There are 5 mains goals in creation of Java.

    1.	It must be simple , object -oriented and Familiar.
    2.	It must be Robust and Secure.
    3.	It must be architectural – neutral and portable.
    4.	It must execute with high performance.
    5.	It must be interpreted, threaded and dynamic.

        :: Declares a class name as Main.
        :: In Java, every application must contain at least one class.

        :: Your class name is same as you save the name of file.
            For Example -
                  class Main - file name is Main
                  class Program - File name is Program.
        :: Always take the class name as File name.

        :: public - Makes the method access from outside the class.
        :: static - Allows the method to be invoked without creating an instance of the class.
        :: void: Indicates that the method does not return a value.
        :: String[] args: Command-line arguments passed to the program.

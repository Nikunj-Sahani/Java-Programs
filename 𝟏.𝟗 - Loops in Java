      >> Loops in Java are control flow statements that execute a block of code repeatedly based on a given condition.
      >> Java provides three main types of loops : 
             > for   ,   > while   ,   > do-while.

    >> For loop is used for execute a lock of code a certain numbers of time.
    >> It is recommended to use for loop when the exact number of iteration is known before.

   Syntax ;;; 
      for (initialization; condition; update)

   For Example ;;;
      <> If you want to print 1 to 10.
            for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)

     >> It is used to execute a specific block of code until a certain condition is found.
     >> It is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance.


   Syntax ;;; 
      for (condition)

   For Example ;;;
      <>  Condition to check before each iteration
           int i = 0;
           while (i < 5) 
           {
              System.out.println(i);
            i++;
           }           // 0 1 2 3 4 (Got Before 5)

     >> It is similar to while loop, The body of do-while loop is executed once before the condition is checked.

   Syntax ;;; 
       do {
         //Code to be executed
       } while (condition);

   For Example ;;;
      int i = 0;
      do {
        System.out.println("Value of i: " + i);
      i++;
      } while (i < 5);
